# selenium-drupal-demo
Python + Selenium demo; Logs into Drupal to edit nodes

This was the result of the requirement to make the same change to several thousand nodes (NIDs came from a JSON feed) on a Drupal site. Yes-- there are PHP solutions but this was an interesting approach, inspired by RSpec + Capybara.
